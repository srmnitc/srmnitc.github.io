**Research Associate (Feb 2021 - present)**  
_[Computational Materials Design, Max-Planck-Institut für Eisenforschung GmbH, Düsseldorf](https://www.mpie.de/CM)_  

Developing software and workflows to enable [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and reproducible research in Materials Science as part of the [NFDI-MatWerk consortium](https://nfdi-matwerk.de/). My work includes the development of the open-source workflow environment [pyiron](https://pyiron.org/), providing open-source access to software using [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/), and organisation of training and workshops. <br><br>


**Research Associate (Oct 2020 - Feb 2021)**  
_[Atomistic modelling and simulation, ICAMS, Ruhr Universität Bochum](http://www.icams.de/content/departments/atomistic-modelling-and-simulation/)_

Developing automated tools for testing and validation of material properties predicted by interatomic potentials as part of [DFG project 405621217](https://gepris.dfg.de/gepris/projekt/405621217?context=projekt&task=showDetail&id=405621217&). My work also includes developement of Machine Learning [Atomic Cluster Expansion](https://github.com/ICAMS/lammps-user-pace) interatomic potentials. <br><br>


**Doctoral candidate (Aug 2018 - Oct 2020)**  
_[Atomistic modelling and simulation, ICAMS, Ruhr Universität Bochum](http://www.icams.de/content/departments/atomistic-modelling-and-simulation/)_

Doctoral student as a part of the [International Max Planck Research School for Interface Controlled Materials for Energy Conversion](https://www.mpie.de/2747306/doctoral_programme) and working in the group [Atomistic simulation of the kinetics of phase transformations](http://www.icams.de/content/departments/atomistic-modelling-and-simulation/atomistic-simulation-of-the-kinetics-of-phase-transformations/). Project is the study of nucleation during solidification in transition metals using atomistic simulation methods like [transition path sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_path_sampling). <br><br>


**Student assistant (Aug 2016 - Aug 2020)**  
_[Atomistic modelling and simulation, ICAMS, Ruhr Universität Bochum](http://www.icams.de/content/departments/atomistic-modelling-and-simulation/)_

Developing and testing of a python wrapper for transition interface sampling. Work responsibilities included developing code to implement the method, testing of the
  code, maintaining a repository and wiki, creating examples and tutorials. <br><br>


**Assistant manager, Manufacturing (Oct 2012 - Jun 2014)**  
_[Commercial vehicles axles, Tata Motors Ltd., Pune, India](https://www.tatamotors.com/)_

Monitoring and planning for daily production, inventory, productivity, cost and
quality targets. Identification of customer quality issues and effective resolution. <br><br>
