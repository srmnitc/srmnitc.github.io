I'm Sarath Menon, currently a research associate at the [Interdisciplinary Centre for Advanced Materials Simulation](http://www.icams.de/content/) at [Ruhr Universit채t Bochum](https://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/en). I work in the department of [Atomistic modelling and simulation](http://www.icams.de/content/departments/atomistic-modelling-and-simulation/) under [Prof. R. Drautz](http://www.icams.de/content/people/icams-staff-members/?detail=6). I work on developing tools for automated analysis and validation of interatomic potentials for application in Materials Science.

In addition to a strong interest in writing scientific programs using C++ and Python,
my research includes the development and testing of machine learning interatomic potentials, with a focus on the investigation of thermodynamic quantities from an atomistic scale.
