I'm Sarath Menon, currently a research associate at the [Max-Planck-Institut für Eisenforschung](https://www.mpie.de/2281/en). I work in the department of [Computational Materials Design](https://www.mpie.de/CM) under [Prof. J. Neugebauer](https://www.mpie.de/person/43010/2763386). I work on developing software and workflows to enable reproducible research in Materials Science as part of the [NFDI-MatWek](https://nfdi-matwerk.de/) consortium.

In addition to a strong interest in writing scientific programs using C++ and Python,
my research includes the development and testing of machine learning interatomic potentials, with a focus on the investigation of thermodynamic quantities from an atomistic scale.
